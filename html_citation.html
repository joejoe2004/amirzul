	<p><blockquote cite="https://www.azquotes.com/quotes/topics/long.html">"As long as I focus on what I feel and don't worry about where I'm going, it works out. Having no expectations but being open to everything is what makes wonderful things happen. If I don't worry, there's no obstruction and life flows easily. It sounds impractical, but 'Expect nothing; be open to everything' is really all it is." ~ Marketa Irglova</blockquote></p>
